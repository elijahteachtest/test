        <span>I have always made art that is dark and distressing in appearance, but not necessarily in essence or
                meaning. I sculpt and paint facets or glimpses of spiritual themes, truths, and concepts seen through the
                lens of historical Christendom. Some of the ideas are grim while others are redemptive. I am aesthetically
                fascinated with the opulence and gaudiness of the Western Church, especially in Roman Catholicism and the
                Orthodox sects of Christianity in Europe. I am curious why these cathedrals and churches are so over-the-top
                and how such decadence has been adapted since the 1st Century Church. My whole life I have been drawn to the
                ritual, pomp, and ceremony of the Western Church, though a great deal of these traditions are not found in
                the scriptures, nor the Hebraic and Jewish roots of the faith. Many customs in Western Christianity are
                rooted in mysticism; they are eerily esoteric, arcane, and cult-like. I create a lot of work that deals with
                eschatology, Revelation, and the spiritual abstraction of the end of our world. I work in the Spanish
                Baroque style, because I love the ornamentation and dark, earthy colors. I like learning the painting
                processes and techniques of the Masters, so that I can achieve a similar aesthetic in my own contemporary
                style of painting. When I work in sculpture, I primarily use plaster pieces cast from molds, found objects,
                and a lot of woodworking. My work does not follow a conceptual formula. Some pieces illustrate a theological
                concept or theme, and some are simply portraits of Saints or biblical passages seldom portrayed in
                art.</span>
